Support async ring https://www.booleanknot.com/blog/2016/07/15/asynchronous-ring.html
Use edited zippers instead of separate params attribute of Router
Consider combining Routable and Routed -what's the point?
Consider either supporting symbols AsSegment or removing support for Keywords -what's the point?

change namespace of keyword key of router in ring request map
Emit distilled routes as pure data
Use spec to coerce short-form routes to full routes.
Catch exceptions parsing path.
